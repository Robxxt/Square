# Square
This program prints a square or rectangle depending on the input sizes. All the code was written using only <unistd.h> library and my own implementation of the other functions.

# How to compile it
There are several way you can compile it in Linux:
*If you have make you just type: `$make`.
*If you have only gcc but not make you type: `$gcc main.c ft_stdlib.c ft_strlib.c -o square`.
